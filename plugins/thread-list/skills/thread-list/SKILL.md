# Thread list preferences

The Thread list plugin owns the sidebar's layout state. Read it with
`bb thread-list prefs list --json`; keys are `threadLifecycles`, `organizationMode`,
`environmentGrouping`, `chronologicalSort`, `sortDirection`, `sectionOrder`,
`manualSectionOrder`, `machineSectionOrder`, `hiddenGroups` (including the
built-in `threads` group),
`collapsedSections`, `collapsedProjects`, `collapsedThreads`,
`collapsedEnvironments`, `collapsedThreadSections`, and `collapsedMachines`.

```sh
bb thread-list prefs list [--json]
bb thread-list prefs get <key> [--json]
bb thread-list prefs set <key> <value> [--json]
bb thread-list prefs reset <key> [--json]
```

`set` takes JSON; a bare word is read as a string, so
`bb thread-list prefs set organizationMode machine` and
`bb thread-list prefs set manualSectionOrder '["pinned","sections","threads"]'`
both work. A value the key's schema rejects fails with
`invalid_preference_value` and leaves the stored value alone. Every open
window applies a change immediately. Sections themselves and a thread's
section are bb core state: use `bb thread section` and `bb thread update`.

On first load the plugin copies any non-default `sidebar.*` values from
`bb settings ui` once; after that the two are independent.

The header's Filter menu selects Active, Archived, or both; at least one must
remain selected. `bb thread-list prefs set threadLifecycles '["archived"]'`
shows archived threads, and `'["active","archived"]'` shows both. The default
is `'["active"]'`. Archived results load in pages; use Show more at the end
of the list. The same preference is available through `setPreference` RPC.
