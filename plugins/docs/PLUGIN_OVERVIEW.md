Collaborate with agents on editing Markdown docs inline. Edit directly inside threads, approve/reject proposals from an agent, and undo/redo changes.

## What you get

- A Docs panel with a folder tree, search, and a rich Markdown editor. Tables, images, and YAML frontmatter are supported.
- Vaults. Each vault is a folder on a host. A new install starts with a Personal vault at `~/Notes`. Add vaults on other machines that are enrolled as bb hosts.
- Full HTML pages and embedded HTML blocks render in a sandboxed frame. Keep interactive reports next to your notes.
- A Markdown opener for `.md` files from file links. Make it the default under Settings.
- `@` mentions. Type `@` in the composer to attach a document. The agent gets its current content at send time.
- Editable document cards in agent replies. Edit Markdown directly in the timeline or open the same document in a tab, with shared autosave.
- Review agent proposals with live diffs. Edit the proposed text, accept or reject it, undo or redo, or ask the agent for changes through a document mention.
- Copy the current draft from the header. Progress appears during saves and proposal actions, and recent documents stay visible when returning to a thread.

## For agents

Agents get the `docs` skill and the `bb docs` command. They list vaults with `bb docs vaults` and read files with `bb docs read`. They edit with `bb docs pull`, `bb docs status`, and `bb docs push`. Push uses version checks, so a concurrent edit is reported as a conflict instead of being overwritten.

Agents can propose changes with `bb docs propose` without replacing the saved document. Proposal updates and approval actions check versions to protect concurrent edits.
