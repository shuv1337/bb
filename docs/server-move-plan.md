# Moving the bb server to another machine

Status: built on this branch behind the default-off `serverMove` experiment
(`bb settings experiment serverMove true`). The server-machine wording, badge,
explainer, add-machine notice, and the Role column in `bb machine list` ship
without the experiment. Implementation contracts live in the code; this document
records the product decisions.

## Goal

Today one computer runs the bb server and every other machine connects to it,
but nothing lets a user make a different computer the server. Someone who
started on a laptop and later bought an always-on desktop has no path except
starting over. "Move server here" copies the server to another machine, points
everything at it, and keeps the old computer working as a regular machine.

## Decisions

### Model

- The server is a role, not "the main computer". The server machine runs the bb
  server: the database, thread history, settings, plugin state, and remote
  access. Every machine, including the server machine, can run agents.
- A move copies server-owned data only. Every machine keeps its host ID and its
  files where they are. Worktrees, thread storage, project checkouts, and
  provider sessions stay on the machines that own them, and host-scoped paths in
  the database are never rewritten.
- The old server machine becomes a regular machine and keeps running its own
  threads.
- User-facing text says "server" and "server machine". The SDK and API keep
  `primaryHostId`, because it is published and plugins read it.

### Scope

- v1 supports a planned move: the old server is online and cooperates.
  Replacing a dead server from a backup and automatic failover are out of scope.
- Targets: any persistent machine, including provider-managed persistent
  machines such as cloud VMs. While a provider-managed machine is the server,
  suspend and remove are disabled, the provider's periodic sweeps skip it, and
  its provider plugin cannot be uninstalled. Ephemeral sandboxes cannot be
  targets.
- Both bb connect and direct-address setups are supported.

### What moves

Moved: `bb.db` (consistent snapshot), `config.json`, `env.json`, `auth-secret`,
`machine-environment-key`, `attachments/`, `plugins/<id>/data.db`,
`plugins/<id>/secrets/`, plugin-owned server files such as automation scripts
and task blobs, installed npm/git plugin packages, plugin state snapshots,
`skills/`, `theme/`, `AGENTS.md`, and `telemetry-id`.

Not moved: logs, caches (`install-cache/`, `plugin-host-artifacts/`,
`skills-generated/`, toolchains), runtime files, and every host-owned file
(`host-id`, `auth.json`, `thread-storage/`, `plugins/<id>/host-data/`,
`plugins/<id>/bridge-data/`, checkouts, provider session stores).

### Flow

1. **Checklist** (`bb server move --to <machine> --check`, and the first screen
   of the dialog). It never copies personal CLI logins between machines. It
   lists:
   - running turns and scheduled automations;
   - offline machines (warning only);
   - path-installed plugins whose source directory is not on the target;
   - Docs vaults with no machine binding;
   - `gh` and Codex logins and local tools the server uses that the target lacks;
   - a timezone difference that shifts core plugin schedules;
   - existing bb server data on the target, which is archived to
     `~/.bb.before-move-<date>` after confirmation and never merged;
   - free disk space in the target's data directory for the export, its
     unpacked copy, and the bb update, with headroom (a blocker when it is
     short, a warning when it is tight);
   - free disk space in the server's own data directory for the export work
     files (database snapshots, the archive, and the bb update package), with
     the same headroom, blocker, and warning;
   - a target that runs a newer bb than the server, which blocks the move until
     the server is updated;
   - the server's custom models, ACP agents, and shared skill roots, which
     replace the target's own.
2. **Confirm** once, in the app or CLI that starts the move. The target does not
   confirm; the server can already run commands on any enrolled machine.
   "Stop all and move" interrupts running turns and pauses schedules.
3. **Align versions:** install the server's exact bb version on the target
   through the existing machine update artifact. The update stays on the
   target even if the move is cancelled.
4. **Freeze and copy:** the old server stops accepting writes and streams an
   export over the target's existing daemon connection, which only that target
   may download, checked end to end with a SHA-256 digest.
5. **Start:** the target imports the export, installs a background service that
   runs server and daemon and starts on boot, and must pass a health check
   before anything switches.
6. **Switch:**
   - bb connect: the connect credential travels in the database. The old server
     drops its tunnel before the new server connects it, and machines and apps
     keep using the same URL.
   - Direct address: the dialog asks for the new server address. Connected
     machines verify they can reach it, then switch before cutover.
7. **Lock the old copy:** bb on the old computer refuses to start a server from
   that data and restarts as a regular machine connected to the new server.

Every connected app shows a full-screen "Moving server to <machine>" with the
steps and reconnects when done. The move continues if the app that started it
closes; `bb server move status` shows the same steps.

### Addresses and clients

- Offline machines (direct address): the old computer keeps answering at the old
  address with the new one for as long as bb runs there, so they switch when
  they come back. If that cannot work, Settings → Machines shows a one-line
  command to run on that machine.
- On the old computer, the desktop app and CLI point at the new server
  automatically and show a one-time "Your server moved to <machine>" notice.
  Browser tabs on the old local address redirect.
- Mobile and desktop profiles on other devices keep working unchanged with bb
  connect. With a direct address, they learn the new address from the old one
  the same way machines do.

### Safety

- Any failure before the switch resumes the old server untouched and cleans up
  the target. A move can be cancelled until the switch.
- Once the target confirms the switch there is no undo; moving back is another
  move. Until it confirms, the move waits in `recovery_required` and can be
  abandoned.
- The locked old copy stays until the user deletes it from that machine's page
  or with `bb server delete-old-copy` on that computer.
- `bb server unlock` on the old computer restarts the old copy as a last resort.
  It warns that everything since the move is lost and that the new server must
  be stopped first.
- `bb server import` writes `server-connect-hold.json`, so the imported server
  starts without bb connect and can't take the original server's tunnel.
  `bb server allow-connect` removes the hold after the original server is
  stopped. A move never writes the hold.
- An imported server applies its fixups (path fixups and machine roles) at its
  first boot without checking the `serverMove` experiment. The import is
  already gated: export needs the experiment on the source server, and
  `bb server import` refuses a manifest that records it as off.
- A server refuses to start on an interrupted import
  (`server-import-journal.json` that no `server-import.json` records) and logs
  that rerunning `bb server import` into that directory rolls it back first.

### Export files

`bb server export` works on a running server through an online SQLite snapshot,
so backups need no downtime. Exports are gzip tar archives and are not
encrypted: they hold the server's credentials and plugin secrets. The CLI writes
them with mode 0600, keeps the file only when it matches the SHA-256 digest the
server sent, and warns that the file must stay private. `bb server import` runs
locally on a machine with no server running, tells the user to re-export an
archive encrypted by an older bb, and refuses, before installing anything, an
export whose manifest records the `serverMove` experiment as off on the server
that wrote it.

## Surfaces

Everything below requires the `serverMove` experiment. While it is off, the
server refuses check, start, export, and old-copy deletion with 403
`server_move_experiment_disabled`, and the app hides Move server here, its
explainer line, and the old server copy section. Move status and cancel stay
available.

UI:
- "Move server here" in a machine's row menu and on its machine page, for
  persistent, connected, active machines that are not the server.
- A move dialog with the checklist, the new address when required, the archive
  confirmation, and "Stop all and move".
- A full-screen move overlay in every connected app.
- The old computer's machine page shows the locked old server copy with a Delete
  action.

CLI (`bb server`):

```
bb server move --to <machine> [--address <url>] [--check] [--archive-existing-data] [--yes] [--json]
bb server move status [--json]
bb server move cancel [--yes] [--json]
bb server export --out <file> [--json]
bb server import <file> [--data-dir <dir>] [--yes] [--json]
bb server unlock [--data-dir <dir>] [--force] [--yes] [--json]
bb server allow-connect [--data-dir <dir>] [--yes] [--json]
bb server delete-old-copy [--data-dir <dir>] [--yes] [--json]
bb server install-machine-service [--data-dir <dir>] [--yes] [--json]
```

`import`, `unlock`, `allow-connect`, and `delete-old-copy` run locally and do
not call a server. `install-machine-service` runs locally on the computer a
server moved away from: it stops bb there and runs
`install-machine.sh --adopt --data-dir <dir>`, which downloads the new server's
bb-app package and installs the persistent, self-updating machine service with
the same machine ID. When the old server ran in the desktop app, the app runs
the same installer itself after the move and on later launches while the
service is missing, then keeps only the old-address responder running.

Routes and SDK (`docs/api_to_audit.md` covers stabilization):

| Route | SDK |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/server/move/check` | `experimental_server.checkMove` |
| `POST /api/v1/server/move` | `experimental_server.startMove` |
| `GET /api/v1/server/move` | `experimental_server.moveStatus` |
| `POST /api/v1/server/move/cancel` | `experimental_server.cancelMove` |
| `POST /api/v1/server/export` | `experimental_server.export` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/hosts/:id/old-server-copy` | `hosts.experimental_deleteOldServerCopy` |

All refuse requests authenticated by a machine credential.

## How it works

- **Where the new server lives:** the target's existing daemon data directory
  (for example `~/.bb-machines/<old-server-host>`). The target keeps its host id,
  worktrees, and thread storage; its service definition switches from
  `bb-app host-daemon` to `bb-app start --data-dir <dir>`, or a detached
  `bb-app start` when there is no service manager. The `host-id` file in that
  directory makes it the server machine.
- **Markers:** `server-import-journal.json` while an import installs files,
  `server-import.json` on the target while the imported server is
  pending (no plugins, sweeps, telemetry, or daemon sessions), `server-moved.json`
  on the old computer after the switch, `last-server-move.json` on the new
  server, and `server-connect-hold.json` after a manual import until
  `bb server allow-connect`. The journal lists the entries the import will
  install and which of them already existed. When an import is interrupted, the
  next prepare on that machine or the next `bb server import` into that directory
  rolls it back from the journal: it restores `server-import-backup/` and removes
  the imported files it created.
- **At the freeze:** running turns stop, plugin schedules pause, and every
  plugin except bb connect is suspended before the target is updated, so
  nothing writes during the update or after the snapshot. Suspending and the
  later plugin shutdown are each time-boxed at 30 seconds; on expiry the move
  logs a warning and continues, and retirement's forced exit covers a hung
  tunnel. A failed, cancelled, or abandoned move lifts the freeze at once, so
  writes, dispatch, and sweeps work again without waiting for plugins, then
  resumes the suspended plugins and plugin schedules. Plugin suspend, resume,
  and stop run one at a time, and a move whose release runs after a newer move
  took over resumes and unfreezes nothing; the newer move owns the plugins.
  SQLite databases are copied with the online backup API.
- **Switch order:** write the lock and the old computer's `config.json`, send
  `server_move.activate` while the tunnel is still up (retrying while the
  target session exists), stop plugins (the old tunnel closes), send
  `server.moved` to machines that need a new address, and retire the old server.
  The target replies to activate, waits for its session to the old server to
  close, stops the pending server, and swaps its service. A refused activation
  rolls the old server back.
- **Unconfirmed activation (`recovery_required`):** when activation gets no
  answer (a lost reply, or the target dropped after the request), the move
  waits in `recovery_required` in both modes. The old server stays up and
  frozen, keeps bb connect running, keeps `server-moved.json` and the rewritten
  `config.json`, sends no `server.moved`, does not retire, and keeps reporting
  no moved address to daemons. It retries `server_move.activate` whenever the
  target daemon is connected (already-activated counts as confirmed) and every
  5 seconds asks a connected daemon, preferably the old server machine's own,
  to probe `<serverUrl>/health` for this move in the ready state. Either
  confirmation finishes the switch exactly like a confirmed activation: plugins
  stop, `server.moved` goes out, and the old server retires. Cancelling in this
  state abandons the move: it removes the lock, restores `config.json` from the
  backup, unfreezes, resumes plugins, and aborts the target once it is
  reachable. If the target already took over, abandoning leaves two servers
  holding the same data, so the CLI asks before abandoning and the app shows
  the warning before its Abandon button. `bb server unlock` stays the exit when
  the old copy has stopped.
- **Durable move state:** the old server writes `server-move-run.json` to its
  data directory on every step transition, persists the `config.json` backup
  and activation time before it asks the target to activate, and records when
  activation is confirmed. The file is not server-owned, so no export includes
  it. At boot, before the app starts, the server reconciles it:
  - no matching `server-moved.json`: the move is abandoned. The work directory
    is removed, `config.json` is restored from the backup, the target is
    aborted once its daemon connects, and the move is published as failed at
    the step it reached;
  - locked and never confirmed: the move comes back as `recovery_required`;
  - locked and confirmed: the server republishes `completed`, skips plugin
    startup, and retires again;
  - confirmed but unlocked with `bb server unlock`: the run is forgotten.

  The `bb-app` launcher refuses to start a server from a locked data directory,
  so the locked branches apply only when the server starts some other way. If
  the old server crashes while recovery is required, the launcher enters moved
  mode and `bb server unlock` is the exit.
- **Progress while the old server is down:** every server's `/health` answers
  any origin, and a new server reports `serverMove: { moveId, state }` there:
  `pending` while it waits for activation, `activating` once the target
  recorded the move but the import marker is still present, and `ready` after
  it restarted as the activated server. In direct mode the move status carries
  `destinationStatusUrl` (`<serverUrl>/health`), and it is null for bb connect.
  When the old server stops answering during `switching` or `completed`, the
  app polls that URL, shows "Starting the server on <machine>", and opens the
  new address only once the destination reports `ready` for this move. The
  redirect carries `bbServerMove=<moveId>`, so the new origin shows the arrival
  toast and then drops the parameter. bb connect keeps the same URL, so the app
  waits for that address to answer with the finished move instead.
- **Retrying a start:** `startMove` for the same target returns the move
  already underway, including one still passing its checks; a different target
  still gets 409 `server_move_in_progress`.
- **The old computer:** the `bb-app` launcher sees the lock, runs the daemon
  against the new address, and answers the old port with 410 `server_moved`
  (HTML requests redirect in direct mode). Moving the server back releases that
  port while the import is pending and returns to a normal start once the lock
  is gone.

## Not built yet

- Settings → Machines does not yet show a command for machines that stay offline
  through a direct-address move and cannot reach the old computer.
- Uninstalling the provider plugin that manages a provider-managed server
  machine is not blocked yet (suspend, resume, and provider sweeps are).
- No UI for export or import; they are CLI and SDK only.

## Verification

Done on this branch:
- Unit and integration suites for every touched package, including fail-before
  mutations of the key guards (activation ordering, freeze, allowlists, systemd
  escaping, launcher moved mode).
- An end-to-end run with packaged `bb-app` installs in isolated homes on one
  Linux host, direct addresses, no service manager: experiment refusal, move
  A→B, remote old-copy deletion, launcher restart in moved mode, and a move back
  B→A.

Not verified yet:
- A bb connect move against the real gate.
- launchd and systemd service swaps on real machines, and the desktop and mobile
  apps switching over.
- Offline machines switching through the old address, and provider-managed
  targets.
